# Dog_Breed_Prediction

In this project, I worked on various methods of building a convolutional neural network that can classify dog breeds.
Summary
Datasets

    Download the dog dataset (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip). Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location dog-project/dogImages.

    Download the human dataset (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip). Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location dog-project/lfw.

    Download the VGG-16 bottleneck (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/DogVGG16Data.npz) features for the dog dataset. Place it in the repo, at location dog-project/bottleneck_features.

    Download the InceptionV3 bottleneck features (https://www.floydhub.com/api/v1/resources/jvPUAqyzSBbHSMk4CynvHJ/DogInceptionV3Data.npz?content=true&rename=doginceptionv3datanpz) - note that this was the specific model I used for transfer learning on my final architecture. Place it in the repo, at location dog-project/bottleneck_features.
